The system is designed to manage flight bookings, billing, customer information, and specialized travel offers, including **Phénix**, a personalized suggestion provided by the company.

The application is built to streamline the agency's operations by organizing data with high security, ensuring efficient customer service and operational management. Users will be able to navigate through different operations with options to add, modify, or delete information stored in the database.

- **Billing System**: Generate and manage invoices for customer bookings and services.
- **Customer Data Management**: Keep track of customer profiles and travel history with high-security storage.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Access all operations through an intuitive menu with options for modifications and updates in real-time.
- **Personalized Offers**: Phénix offers are suggested based on customer preferences, enhancing user engagement.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a **desktop application** for travel agencies to manage bookings, billing, and customer data efficiently.
- Implement a **high-security database** for storing sensitive information.
- Offer **customized travel plans** through Phénix to boost client satisfaction.
- Enable comprehensive task management for the agency's development and operations teams.

## Technologies Used
